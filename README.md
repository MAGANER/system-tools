# system-tools
place to store py scripts, solving different  system tasks. 

# Make it Flat
This script was written for 30 minutes and its meaning to be is to prepare directory<br>
for another script. However, currently i found new better solution, but i will use it anyway.<br>
you run this script from the top of some directory and then it destroys every subdir, moving files<br>
to the top, where script was invoked.<br>
